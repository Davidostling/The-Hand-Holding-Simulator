**The hand holding simulator**

Me and my partner as well as two other students _(from another group)_ worked together to create a _“hand holding simulator”_. It worked by the use of a _time of flight_- as well as a _presence sensor_. When a hand was placed close enough to one of the sensors, it triggered a corresponding servo on the other side of a radio signal to go off. Each servo then placed an artificial hand on each user’s other hand to make it feel like the users were touching. To add upon this a joystick and a button were used to trigger buzzers on each side of a radio signal to alert the each user that they want to hold hands.
