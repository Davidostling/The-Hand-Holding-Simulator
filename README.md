# The Hand Holding Simulator

Me and my partner as well as two other students _(from another group)_ worked together to create a _“hand holding simulator”_. It worked by the use of a _time of flight_- as well as a _presence sensor_. When a hand was brought close enough to one of the sensors, it caused a corresponding servo on the other side of the radio signal to activate. Each servo then placed an artificial hand on the other hand of each user, creating the sensation of hand-to-hand contact. In addition, a joystick and a button were used to trigger buzzers on each side of the radio signal, alerting each user that they desire to hold hands.
