The hand holding simulator
Me and my partner as well as two other students (from another group) worked together to create a “hand holding simulator”. It worked by the use of a time of flight- as well as a presence sensor. When a hand was placed close enough to one of the sensors, it triggered a corresponding servo on the other side of a radio signal to go off. Each servo then placed an artificial hand on each user’s other hand to make it feel like the users were touching. To add upon this a joystick and a button were used to trigger buzzers on each side of a radio signal to alert the each user that they want to hold hands.
